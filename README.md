<h1>Multiple Disease Prediction Web App</h1>

Project Overview:
This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that integrates three machine learning models to predict the likelihood of:

Diabetes – Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Heart Disease – Logistic Regression

Parkinson’s Disease – Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The app allows users to enter health-related data and receive instant predictions, making early detection more accessible and user-friendly.

<h2>Description</h2>
Problem Statement:
Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s often go undiagnosed until advanced stages, reducing treatment effectiveness. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming, costly, and inaccessible to many people.
This project addresses the need for a fast, accessible, and reliable way to provide preliminary health risk assessments using machine learning and a simple web interface.


<h2>Skills </h2>

- </b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- </b>Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM</b>
- </b>Feature engineering</b>
- </b>Model Evaluation & Performance Tuning</b>
- </b>Model Deployment – Streamlit Cloud</b>


<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- </b>Built a multi-disease prediction platform using ML.

Achieved high accuracy in predicting all three diseases.

Created a user-friendly, real-time web app for health risk assessment.
